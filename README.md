# Coronavirus Predictor
THIS REPOSITORY CONTAINS A MODEL TO PREDICT THE CORONA VIRUS TREND IN A DAILY BASIS

**ABOUT & GUIDELINES**
![banner-coronavirus_0](https://github.com/imildositoe/coronavirus_predictor/assets/31238878/ade156d0-9670-4c14-b133-c26a5811f201)

The program runs a pure python code to create a model to predict how many cases will be generated  in the selected area within a defined interval of 30 days. 
The code uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.preprocessing, PolynomialFeatures, and sklearn libraries to support the manipulation and visualization of results.

The source code is divided by: 
> > Loading the data<br/>
> > Preparing the data<br/>
> > Training the data<br/>
> > Predicting the result<br/> 

**RESULT**
![ploted_graph](https://github.com/imildositoe/coronavirus_predictor/assets/31238878/1efb8956-c7ff-4069-92ff-b544bcb4c627)

The result of the code is shown as a ploted linear regression function visualizing the the best fit model for the given number of cases as well as the _prediction_ in 30 days. 
The below lines can be used as a legend for the generated graph (color: legend):
> > Magenta: initial given number of cases<br/>
> > Blue: traininng function<br/>
> > Red: prediction 1
